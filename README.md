Coding Samurai C++ Internship Projects

Welcome to my **C++ internship project portfolio**, developed as part of the **Coding Samurai Internship Program**. This repository contains a set of six structured and functional C++ applications that demonstrate my understanding of core programming concepts including OOP, data structures, algorithms, and basic AI.

Project List

1. Calculator App
- A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Uses conditional statements and `switch-case`
- Handles division by zero errors gracefully

📁 Folder: `Calculator App`

---

2. Number Guessing Game
- The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100
- The player tries to guess the number
- Hints are provided (Too low / Too high) until correct

📁 Folder: `Number Guessing game`

---

3. Bank Account Management System
- Allows a user to create an account, deposit, withdraw, and check balance
- Implements **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** using a `BankAccount` class
- Includes input validation and user-friendly interaction

📁 Folder: `Bank account Management System`

---

4. Student Management System
- Allows you to add, view, search, and delete student records
- Uses a `struct` and array to store multiple students
- Demonstrates use of functions, loops, and conditional logic

📁 Folder: `Student Management System`

---

5. Tic Tac Toe Game (with AI)
- Play against an unbeatable AI using the **Minimax algorithm**
- Implements a 3x3 grid game with full input validation
- Uses recursion and decision trees for AI logic

📁 Folder: `Tic Tac Toe Game(AI)`

---

6. File Compression Tool (Huffman Coding)
- Compresses text input using **Huffman Encoding**
- Builds a frequency map, creates a Huffman Tree, and generates binary codes
- Demonstrates understanding of greedy algorithms, trees, and maps

📁 Folder: `File Compression tool`

---

Technologies Used
- Language: C++
- Tools: Visual Studio 2022, Git, GitHub
- Concepts: OOP, recursion, arrays, structs, classes, algorithms

---

How to Run
1. Open each folder in Visual Studio
2. Build the solution (`Ctrl+Shift+B`)
3. Run the program (`Ctrl+F5`)

Each folder contains `.cpp` files with full code and logic.
